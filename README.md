This is a project I made for OOP class. <br />
▪ The system is built to help a company efficiently manage itself by adjusting the employees’ working hours. <br />
▪ The system allows the employees to change their work preferences. It also allows departments and roles to control their employees’ working hours. <br />
▪ The system calculates the company’s average profit which depends on its employees working time.
